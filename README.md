In the current digitally inclined age, application of traditional password authentication mechanisms presents grave security hazards. Conventional systems are vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, keylogging, and shoulder surfing, all of which can expose static passwords to attackers. These dangers highlight the necessity for a more secure and adaptive authentication mechanism that reconciles user convenience with modern security threats.To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Grid-Based Dynamic Password Authentication System, which enhances security by generating dynamic passwords based on user-specified patterns on a randomly ordered grid. Unlike traditional methods where users input static passwords, the proposed system requires users to select a predefined sequence of grid positions. Each time the user attempts to login, the system generates a new 9Ã—9 grid with randomized numeric values, and the user inputs values at their chosen positions. This results in dynamic passwords that change with every login attempt, rendering intercepted data useless for future sessions.
This technique significantly reduces susceptibility to keylogging, shoulder surfing, and phishing attacks. Moreover, the system integrates AES-192 encryption for securely storing user patterns and leverages Firebase for cloud-based data management and backup. The proposed approach balances usability with robust security, making it suitable for sensitive domains such as banking, e-commerce, and confidential data access.
